After building this program, you get requests to add features to it. It works great in the situation where there is only one bank account type. Over time, needs change, and related account types are requested:

	a) An interest earning account that accrues interest at the end of each month.

	b) A line of credit that can have a negative balance, but when there's a balance, there's an interest charge each month.

	c) A pre-paid gift card account that starts with a single deposit, and only can be paid off. It can be refilled once at the start of each month.

The requirements for the new classes can be stated as follows:

(Savings Account) An interest earning account:
	Will get a credit of 2% of the month-ending-balance.

A line of credit:
	Can have a negative balance, but not be greater in absolute value than the credit limit.
	Will incur an interest charge each month where the end of month balance isn't 0.
	Will incur a fee on each withdrawal that goes over the credit limit.

A gift card account:
	Can be refilled with a specified amount once each month, on the last day of the month.
