		Value Type and Refrence Type
				
		Value Type -
		- All primitive type variable are structures
		- Memory is allocated on stack
		- Memory alocation is done automatically
		- the variable is removed whenever it is out of scope
		
		Reference Type --
		- As a programmer we allocate memory to variables
		- Memory is allocated in heap memory
		- Garabage collection concept frees up  the memory
		- Garabage collection is done by CLR
